# Unicorn-Companies
This project analyzes the unicorn companies, focusing on the top cities with the most unicorns and the top investors who have funded the most unicorns. The analysis is based on a dataset that contains information about unicorn companies, including their names, founding dates, industries, and investors.

The project includes Python code that performs the following tasks:

Group the data by city and count the number of unicorns in each city
Get the top 10 cities with the most unicorns
Create a bar plot to visualize the top cities
Create a list of all investors
Count the number of unicorns each investor has funded
Plot a bar graph of the top 5 investors
Getting Started
To run the code, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy
pip install pandas matplotlib
Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the code by opening a terminal or command prompt and navigating to the directory containing the Python file. Then, run the following command:

Copy
python unicorn_analysis.py
This will execute the code and generate the bar plots for the top cities and top investors.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in a CSV file named unicorns.csv. It contains information about unicorn companies, including their names, founding dates, industries, and investors.

Results
The analysis of the unicorn ecosystem revealed the following insights:

The top cities with the most unicorns are dominated by major startup hubs, with Silicon Valley leading the way.
The top 5 investors who have funded the most unicorns are Accel, Tiger Global Management, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital China, and Insight Partners.
